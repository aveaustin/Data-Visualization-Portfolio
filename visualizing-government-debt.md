# Visualizing Government Debt
These are various representations of government debt, as a percentage of their GDP

## Embedding directly from OECD.org

## A Grid of Line Charts

## My own custom visualizations

A static chart which allows the user to select individual countries and see how the line changes from the previous country
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/14931058"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This visualization could be optimal for a scenario in which the viewer would like to assess the debt-to-GDP of individual countries and have the ability to switch from one to another and see how the respective line changes when a different country is selected

## A dynamic visualization showing the top five debt-to-GDP ratios over the full timespan
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/14931378"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This visualization would be useful to get a quick glimpse at how the highest debt-to-GDP countries have changed over time. While not useful for a specific quantitative analysis, this visualization could be useful if the debt-to-GDP landscape was a talking point within a larger context.
