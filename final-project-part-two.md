# Final Project Part II: Wireframes and User Research

## Wireframing

The wireframe of my project can be found [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/shifting-the-paradime/index.html) and is essentially a draft of my project.

It still needs some work, so stay tuned for Part III where I tie it all together. 

## User Research

I interviewed individuals who fit into my target audience and asked them questions about the story, its clarity, and impact. Their responses are recorded below.

My approach for identifying individuals to interview followed a general thought process of "who do I know who likely makes around the median income, and won't feel like I'm calling them poor with this request?" After brainstorming for a while, I reached out to some friends to get their responses. I asked some questions to tease out areas to improve, but also asked about strong points to ensure their utility in the presentation. 

### Subject 1:

28 year old male, undergraduate degree, low level manager at grocery store

**Question 1**: Does the storyline flow, or did any part feel out of place?

*It flows pretty well, it takes us through the issue and then narrows it in for how individuals can solve it.*

**Question 2**: Was anything confusing or unclear?

*No, but the first chart was ugly and it looks terrible. What you have vs what you need is confusing before the what you need pops up. Explain it further because it looks like a data report. Give it context. You immediately look at the graph staring at it until you scroll down far enough to actually understand what it's trying to show*

**Question 3**: What is the most informative section of the presentation?

*The average cost of living vs income chart showing how the difference in left over money was very useful in explaining how the issue applies to the modern American.*

**Question 4**: Was anything particularly impactful or distracting?

*The first graph is distracting but the other two are good. The stacked area graph needs some refinement because it’s a lot to take in. Maybe wash out the shading.*

**Question 5**: Is there anything missing that I should include?

*Include something data driven for the what to do section. It sounds like boomers “just cut back!”. Maybe hit on their argument of “stop drinking starbucks”. Emphasize that that’s not enough to buy a house, it’s just the first step. Maybe show how much money you could save if you saved all of your starbucks money over 30 years.*

**Question 6**: Is the content motivating for the audience? If not, what would help?

*No its motivating, but its also not new news. It’s a washed-out message that everyone hears on tiktok and IG and from their parents.*

Any other feedback?

*Maybe have it directly call people out. Like "if you didn't have any income for the next 4 months, would you be okay? If not, consider these steps... and even include that steps 2 and 3 still apply even if you would be okay.*

### Subject 2: 

27 year old female, undergraduate degree, works in HR at a local company

**Question 1**: Does the storyline flow, or did any part feel out of place?

*It flowed really well and got to the point quickly. The only thing that interrupted the natural flow was the sizing of The Cost of Living and Excess Over Time graphs. Maybe full size graphs would work well since they’re the only thing on the screen.*

**Question 2**: Was anything confusing or unclear?
*Not unclear, but I was naturally looking for an axis or reference on the first graph. I think it is powerful without an axis, but maybe just tick markets or a couple pointers on the graph.*

**Question 3**: What is the most informative section of the presentation?

*The phone in the jean pocket and all the subtractions from money.*

**Question 4**: Was anything particularly impactful or distracting?
*Not from my perspective.*

**Question 5**: Is there anything missing that I should include?

*Maybe make that $7,500 on the Less Excess Over Time graph stand out because it’s carried over to the next slide.*

**Question 6**: Is the content motivating for the audience? If not, what would help?

*I found it motivating and told an effective story.*

### Subject 3: 

High School graduate, 21 years old, currently working as a cashier and attending community college (major is undecided)

**Question 1**: Does the storyline flow, or did any part feel out of place?

*Overall I really like the flow. It follows a "Setup, Conflict, Resolution" type of style and feels like it makes sense.*

**Question 2**: Was anything confusing or unclear?

*The first chart is unclear until the reader scrolls down far enough to make the second line appear. This could confuse people who aren't scrolling at their own pace, or just seeing only one line might even make someone click away before they give themselves the chance to see the full chart.*

**Question 3**: What is the most informative section of the presentation?

*The final section about steps that can be taken is most informative. I would either A) include more links to other sites where people can learn more about each specific topic, or B) include more information in the presentation itself delving into the topics a bit more.*

**Question 4**: Was anything particularly impactful or distracting?

*Other than the first chart being initially confusing as mentioned earlier, everything is pretty clear/easy to understand*

**Question 5**: Is there anything missing that I should include?

*Not missing, but I would add more description for the charts, specifically the "Less Excess Over Time" chart. Maybe include a little info on how the data was collected or even just an explanation of what the chart is saying. You'll probably explain it as you present your presentation in class, but if someone were to read it without you speaking over it, a little extra info would help. In general, I would say there could be a little more room for another chart or two, maybe another way of visualising the "trivial" expenses that add up or perhaps a visualization of one of the "what to do" bullets like how even small monthly contributions and investments in a roth ira can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in 30 years*

**Question 6**: Is the content motivating for the audience? If not, what would help?

*I found it motivating and told an effective story.*

# Moving Forward: Things to Change for Part III

I received some good insight from my interviews. Overall it sounds like I'm on the right track, but here I will highlight some of my concerns and my thoughts about addressing them. 

|           Point to Address           |                                                                                           Thoughts or Actions to Remediate Issue                                                                                           |
|:------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| "Washed Out Message"                 | This is my primary concern. This message is not novel or unique. As subject 1 mentioned, "boomers always say 'just cut back!' "                                                                                            |
| First Graph Clarity                  | I fell into a trap of trying to include something stylistically cool, but its a little gimmicky. I think I might substitute this for a photo or a graph that shows all of the information up front                         |
| First Dataviz                        | Diminish the shading in the stacked area graph and highlight the topline as the total cost of living                                                                                                                       |
| Second Dataviz                       | Emphasize the excess $7500 since that gets carried forward in the presentation                                                                                                                                             |
| Lack of Data on "What to do" section | To fix this, I will include another graph which highlights how much money a person will have in 40 years if they save $350 per year or if they save a larger amount after cutting back. The difference should be massive.  |
| Weak call to action                  | This goes along with the washed out message. I will likely prompt the reader to stop and think, "do I have enough money to live for 3-4 months with no income"                                                             |
| Trivial expenses graph               | I will create a graph that shows how the trivial expenses add up over time, eating into the excess cash after living-expenses                                                                                              |
