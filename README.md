# About Me
Thanks for visiting my page!

I'm a Masters of Information Systems Management: Business Intelligence and Data Analytics student at Heinz College. Thus far I have enjoyed learning about and dabbling in various flavors of data analytics. I also have a degree in mechanical engineering and enjoy solving problems of various types. My studies here at Carnegie Mellon have inspired new interests which blend the lines of data and engineering (autonomous vehicles, for example). I love to learn and hopefully you will find something interesting here on my page.

# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to develop and refine skills in data visualization. Following this course, I'm hoping that my work will boast clean and easily-understood graphics and visuals which provide clear context to my findings. I think we have all seen _bad_ data visualization attempts (I've even produces some myself), but it's typically easier to say something is bad than to actually fix it. Hopefully this course will allow me to achieve both throughout my future work. 
Following graduation, I will work as a data engineer at ~~redacted~~.
