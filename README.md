# About Me
I enjoy learning about and dabbling in various flavors of data analytics

# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to develop and refine skills in data visualization. Following this course, I'm hoping that my work will boast clean and easily-understood graphics and visuals which provide clear context to my findings.
