# Data Visualization Part Three: Shifting the Paradime

The final shorthand webpage can be found [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/shifting-the-paradime/index.html), or below my comments. 

## Changes From Part Two

After conducting user research in part two, a few changes were inspired by the feedback that I received from my interviews. During the interview process, I talked my users through the overall goal of the project and they were free to examine my shorthand page after I directed them through the gist of the presentation. From the feedback I received, I made the following changes:

### A Washed out message:

This was my primary concern. One of my reviewers mentioned how this this message is not novel or unique. As subject 1 mentioned, this is a message that is told to younger Americans on a regular basis. Frequently we are told to stop buying avocado toast and starbucks to afford the prices of living. My primary means to address this was with my second data visualization, found below:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/15230975"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The primary change I made here was highlighting the two spans of time in different colors. This allowed me to show that previously, there was a healthy (green) amount of excess funds compared to our generation (in red). These colors help paint the picture that over the last 10 years, we are worse off than those living prior to 2012. In doing this, I hoped to show that quantitatively, the bare necessities of living cost more than they used to, regardless of avocado toast. It does not necessarily dispell cutting back as a myth, but instead helps suggest it as a solution to the issue. 

### The First Graph: Don't let this happen to you
As I mentioned in part 2, I fell into a trap of trying to include something stylistically cool, but its a little gimmicky. I ended up removing the animated graph that built as you scrolled because until the reader scrolled down far enough, it was just confusing. I settled on a graph that just shows the cost of living surpassing your personal finances, without actual dollar amounts. I intentionally did not want this graph to be interpreted as data, but instead provide an one-shot summary of what I will talk about on the page. This also inspired the "Don't let this happen to you" title. I also chagned the line lables from "what you have/ need" to "$ you have/ need" to make it clear that I was talking about money. Overall I think this met the intent much better than the origiginal scrolling graph. 

### Lack of Data in the "What to do" Section

I received feedback that the "What to do" section could also benefit from some type of dataviz. At this point in the project I had built a narrative about how yougner generations don't enjoy the economic climate our parents did, and suggest changes. Having used a hypothetical example of what someone spends on varous non-essential activities (and how they eat into your savable money), I thought it would be good to continue this narrative, but in a positive way. This resulted in adding a section which showed some of the annual dollars you can save by cutting out a few luxuries in life. Then, using those savings, I plotted what a high-yield savings accound would return before or after our minimal lifestyle adjustments. Overall I think this was the best update I made to the overall project. Because it is at the end of the page, it's the last thing the reader sees, and hopefully will stick in their memory. In hindsight, I would update the visualization to better emphasize the massive $150,000 in savings vs. the small $30,000. In either case, this graph really ties together the overall point of the presentation. Cutting back, although it sounds like a washed out message, can have a massive impact on one's financial future. 

### Weak Call to Action

As I mentioned in part one, this project was inspired by my work with my non-profit organization. My page showed data for the average American, and 100% of the time my non-profit steps in to help a family, they are below the average threshold. A common theme among these families is an overall ignorance about financial literacy and savings strategies. We helped a single mother of five get on track to pay her rent, and get on-schedule for her debt, and it was easy. The primary mechanism was simply cutting back and budgeting! By gettinf rid of streaming subscriptions, downgrading her cellphone plan, grocery shopping more often, and other small changes, she was shocked to see money still in her account at the end of the month. I think this gets at the target audience portion of this presentation. Although it does not resonate with CMU graduate students, there are many familes in America who are simply ignorant to what they can do to turn their finances around. We have built mechanisms to help these families cut back, but usually it's hard to get them to understand *why* they are falling short in the first place. This project was an effort to paint that picture. Hopefully the final graph is strong enough to encourage readers to do more research on financial literacy and take their finances into their own hands with their own plan for the future. 

# Project Overview

This project taught me a lot. The first (and worst) lesson was that data is not provided in a medium that is specifically tailored for your use-case. I probably evaluated over 30 different data tables and found some to be too much, too little, or so terribly formatted that it would take too long to extract. I almost abandoned this topic all together because of this, but I'm glad I didn't. The data-wrangling process was terrible, but I learned some valuable skills (most notably was how to unpivot tables through MS Excel's "Power Query" feature). This process also inspired me to learn how to use Tableua Prep in the future. 

The next hurdle I had to overcome was creativity. My undergraduate degree is in mechanical engineering, and my hobbies include building things (both in the real-world such as cars, or also in code such as java programs that can read cursive). I typically face black and white objectives. The bridge collapses or it doesn't. The program works or not. The idea of creating my own final product, without a specific, quantitatively testible result is daunting to me. Building my shorthand page was very difficult at first. Which photos do I use? Where do I put text? Should this be a header? Bold? What about the color?... I eventually to sit down and just stop thinking, start doing. I found that once I got my thoughts down on the page, the story began coming together one section at a time. It seemed more and more obvious what I should or shoulnd't do as I went. This was a huge relief, and pretty inspiring for myself come future projects. This isn't the kind of work I typically do, and I'm glad I have leared to do it because now I truly feel like I have a leg up on making data tell a story. 

Finally, Tableau: I suck at it. For the first 8 hours or work on part two, I was dead set on using tableua. It's a program I have always wanted to learn, so I was forcing myself to use it. My will was eventually broken when I could not, for the life of me, get the visualizations to look even close to what I had in mind. Thankfully I am strong willed, and have now enrolled in a tableua specific course to polish those skills up further. 

As far as the project goes, some parts were not *hard*, but were extremely beneficial (the primary one being the user research portion). I found it extremely useful to get external perspective on my project while still working on it. Each person provided unique insights, and drew my attention to things that I would not have otherwise thought twice about. This is a useful technique that I plan to employ for future projects, no matter what type.
